## Introduction

MongoDB sharding is a powerful feature that allows you to scale your database horizontally by distributing data across multiple servers. This repository provides scripts and guidelines to help you set up and manage sharded collections in your MongoDB Atlas cluster.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- **MongoDB Atlas Account**: Access to a MongoDB Atlas cluster with sharding enabled.
- **MongoDB Shell or MongoDB Compass**: Tools for interacting with your MongoDB cluster.
- **Access Credentials**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions to enable sharding and manage collections.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Connect to MongoDB Atlas

First, connect to your MongoDB Atlas cluster using the MongoDB shell or another preferred tool:

```bash
mongo "mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-url>/admin"
Replace <username>, <password>, and <cluster-url> with your specific details.

2. Enable Sharding on the Database
To enable sharding for your database, use the following command:

javascript
Copy code
sh.enableSharding("<your_database_name>")
Replace <your_database_name> with the name of the database you want to shard.

3. Shard Collections
To shard a collection, follow these steps:

Choose a shard key. For example, to shard by the _id field:
javascript
Copy code
sh.shardCollection("<your_database_name>.<collection_name>", { "_id": "hashed" })
Replace <your_database_name> and <collection_name> with your database and collection names.

Monitor the sharding process:
javascript
Copy code
sh.status()
This command will display the current sharding status of your collections.

Scripts Overview
This repository contains the following scripts:

shard-setup.sh: A bash script to automate the process of enabling sharding and sharding collections.
shard-status.js: A JavaScript file to check the current sharding status.
Best Practices
Choose a Proper Shard Key: Selecting the right shard key is critical for balancing data across shards.
Monitor Sharding: Regularly check the status of your sharded collections to ensure optimal performance.
Backup Data: Always backup your data before performing any sharding operations.
